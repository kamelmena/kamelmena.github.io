                <p>You don’t have it in you today to try to be social. You jump the fence, the low fence, by the baseball field. It’s such a nice day, that you decide you don’t need to go back to your closet for comfort, you’ve been wanting to check out the bird sanctuary down at the park. 


The birds are boring and exciting at the same time. They have somewhat human features, which fascinate you, but also freak you out. What are beaks made out of anyway? You spend some time mesmerized by the cormorants, but you feel a ting of sadness creep in.</p>

<p>
“Is it really easier to hang out with animals than with my own species,” you think to yourself.


You consider going back to school to try making some new friends, a possibility that was never on the table before. What do you do?
