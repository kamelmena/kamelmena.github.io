                <p> You like Fridays, because that means it’s nearly the weekend. You consider wearing something festive, and clean, like a bowtie, but you don't want too look like you’re trying too hard.                 </p>
    
                <p>You throw on a black t-shirt and sweater, and you look over at your closet and think, “Do I have it in me today? Should I just go back to bed?” The closet is enticing, and maybe you can get 5 more minutes of quiet before mom comes up to force you into going to school...but you’re hungry and ran out of your secret stash of snacks…</p>
