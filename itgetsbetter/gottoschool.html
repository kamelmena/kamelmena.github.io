                <p> School is alright, you’re pretty smart, but the other kids bully you and it’s hard to focus on the good parts. To get extra credit in your English class, you auditioned and got a part in the school’s production of Grease. You definitely didn’t think you’d get a part, let alone a speaking part.
                </p>
    <p>Speaking of speaking, a group of castmates keeps inviting you over to hang out with them during lunch, but you’ve been such a loner for most of your life, you don’t really feel comfortable around people, even though you want to be. Are your loner days over today?
