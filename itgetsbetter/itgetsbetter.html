                <h2>The Closet</h2>

                <p> It’s pretty crap in here, but you’ve gotten used to it. The smell of your closet has become a familiar one.  A haven of sorts where you often hang out alone because no one bothers you, you have your closet set up as your own personal clubhouse. You get to read and think in peace there, eat snacks, sleep. Some people might perceive a pile of dirty clothes in the dark to be depressing, but it’s not that bad--clothes make great cushions.
                </p>
    
                <p>In the mornings, before you face the world, you typically meditate in the closet. It helps you get prepared for the day. Sometimes you can spend the whole day in there--time flies when you’re having fun by yourself. But alas, it’s Friday, one more day of school this week and you can hear your mom yell for you to come down to go downstairs.</p>
