                <p>“How’s it going,” you ask awkwardly as you walk up to these literal strangers. You swear they could see you sweating, and they’re going to think you’re so lame for being so thirsty.
                </p>
                <p>“What’s up, you’re in the musical this year, right,” the guy with a blue bandana around his neck asks. “Ya,” I say nervously, “it’s first time I've been in one.” </p>


                <p>“You’ve got a great voice, but your dance moves are gonna need some work.”</p>


<p>Everyone laughs a little, and you’re surprised to feel comfortable among these theater weirdos. You sit, and try to learn everyone’s names as best you can without looking like that’s all you’re focused on. Twenty minutes fly by, and the bell rings. You think to yourself, “Did I just make friends?” </p>


<p>“See you after school at our first rehearsal,” they yell back at me as they walk together to their next class. </p>


                <p>You’re thrilled and exhausted, and you smile considering the possibilities of belonging to a community of like-minded people.</p>
