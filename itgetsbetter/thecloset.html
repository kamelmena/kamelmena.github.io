                <p> That was a valiant effort at living life on the edge. You’re feeling pretty wiped and could use some real Q.T. with yourself. The thing about your cozy closet is that you don’t have to live up to anyone else’s expectations.                </p>
    
                <p>You think to yourself, “Today was a good day, there’s always tomorrow to try more.”</p>
