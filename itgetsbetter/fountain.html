                <p>Fountains are pretty dope--they control water. You could zone out here for hours, and just watch water conform to both man and gravity--what a great relationship. The natural and the manmade, not separate but working in unison. 
                    <br>
                    <br>The fountain has a good sunny spot on the east side near the pigeons, and youâ€™re pretty committed to the birds today so you decided it's a sign to hang out here. 
                </p><p>You get comfortable and consider which of your favorite activities feels right for the moment.
