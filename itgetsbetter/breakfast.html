                <p> Breakfast is so lame at your my house. If what people say is true--that it’s the most important meal of the day--why does your mom treat it with less attention than a Holiday Inn continental spread? The tacky clock on the way starts chirping--the Robin means you have a couple minutes before you gotta get going, otherwise you’ll be late for school. Oh well! But, they started locking the doors to the entrance now right at 7:30AM. Would it be that bad if you couldn’t get in?                 </p>
    
                <p>“Son, get your ass out of this house and onto that bus,” Mama yells, as she shoves a plate of gourmet options your way. You know you have to take something, otherwise you’ll get a speech about respect.</p>
