                    <p>Ms. Jennifer Avancena was a delight, professional and a fantastic representative of your hotel. Her attention to detail, her flexibility with working with me and the other two members of the CA Dept of Veterans Affairs were impeccable. Their interaction with Jennifer was significantly impressive.<br><br><strong>

                    <p>I had the pleasure of working with Jennifer recently when I held a conference… She couldn't do enough for us and always professional and with a smile. I would highly recommend Jennifer and hope that we can work together again in the future!
